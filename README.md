# Rails 7.1 Authentication From Scratch (from Go Rails)

This is based on the [Go Rails](https://gorails.com/) authentication from scratch. Given that the code was not provided, I typed it all up.

The only changes from the video are:
- the usage of strong params in sessions_controller.rb as Chris suggested
- minimum password length (12 characters)
- a requirement of 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 digit, and 1 special character
